    "# Calamity Prep Score 1: The Mean College Literacy Rate of Each Baranggay\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions: \n",
    "1. Based on a study by INSERT AUTHORS AND LINK, having college students and college grads in the family increases their chance of surviving calamities. And so we used EDUCAL (educational attainment) as a means of scoring the average post-secondary literacy of each family in each baranggay.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. We assumed that the number of responses per family represents the total size of the family and so used it as the denominator to which we compared the number of college grads and students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We assumed that invalid responses such as '300' and NaN values are automatically not within range of the 1st year college (32) to PhD (37). We did not drop these responses as it will cause an inaccurate family size. We tried dropping them but a 5 member family just became 2 because 3 of them did not properly answer and still had 100% literacy because the only 2 valid responses are within college and PhD range.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "1. Created a filtered dataframe copy of the original Main.CSV file that only contains the relevant variables for Score 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determined family size ('family_size') by counting the number of responses of with the same 'mainid' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Determined college students and grads ('above_PS') by counting the number of responses of with 32 to 37 as EDUCAL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Determined the ratio of 'above_PS' over 'family_size' to get each family's college literacy rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Grouped the families by baranggay and then computed for the mean college literacy rate of each baranggay."
